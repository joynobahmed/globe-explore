## API Integration

The application leverages two public APIs to retrieve country and weather data:

### REST Countries API

```
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${countryName}?fullText=true
```

This API provides comprehensive country information including:

-   Country name and official name
-   Capital city
-   Continental location
-   Population statistics
-   Flag images
-   And more

### wttr.in Weather API

```
https://wttr.in/${countryName}?format=j1
```

This API delivers current weather conditions for the specified country:

-   Temperature
-   "Feels like" temperature
-   Humidity percentage
-   Precipitation levels
-   Atmospheric pressure
-   UV index
-   Visibility range

The application uses these APIs through the implemented `getCountryData()` and `getWeatherData()` functions which handle the API requests and format the data for display.

## Usage

1. Enter a country name in the search field
2. Click the "Search" button or press Enter
3. View the country information and weather data
4. Click "Weather Details" to expand additional weather information
